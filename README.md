#passwordMake#

A simple password manager in python.

##Introduction##

I basically threw this together over a few days playing with the idea of writing a simple password manager.  This code works sort of, but not really. Mainly, though, the code is written like junk. Because of this, I'm currently rewriting the project as an actual project called SPMIP.  All further work is going on there.

**Again, all actual work is now happening on SPMIP, which will be on github shortly**
